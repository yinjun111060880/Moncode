# Moncode
Moncode network coding library is an open source C library which is designed for the software implementation of network coding over heterogeneous platforms. Given the different storage performance of different plat-form, Moncode provides a variety of time and space overhead finite field operations implementation algorithms. Morever，to provide user friendly network coding library, Moncode uses a hierarchical structure to improve the scalability of the soft-ware library. Next, we will provide several network coding test demos which is developed based on Moncode.
